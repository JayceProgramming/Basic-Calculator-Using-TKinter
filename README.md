# Basic-Calculator-Using-TKinter
Basic function calculator in python using TKinter for GUI.

GUI was not made to be appealing but made to demonstrate the functions of TKinter

This project consists of two .py files:

  CalculatorClass.py contains:
  
    1 Class:
      Calculator: 
        3 Constructors:
          Default Constructor That Takes No Parameters
        
          Constructor That Takes Two Parameters | Width, and Height:
            This Constructor Can Be Used To Customize Only The Size Of The Calculator
            
          Constructor That Takes Three Parameters | Title, Width, and Height:
            This Constructor Can Be Used To Customize The Title, Width, and Height Of The Calculator
            
    1 Method:
      calculatorBuilder:
        This method Builds and Creates the calculator using the 3 passed parameters | Title, Width, and Height
        This method is called in all three constructors 

  Calculator.py contains:
    This file is just a runner for the calculator. When this file is run the user will be given three options:
      
      1. Default Calculator:
        if chosen it will create a calculator using the default values set in the class
      
      2. Custom Size Calculator:
        if chosen it will ask the user for two inputs, width and height and then create a calculator using those values
      
      3. Custom Size and Title Calculator
        This one is similar to choose 2 but it will also ask the user for the title along with the width and height
